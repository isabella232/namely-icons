# Namely Icons

A set of commonly used icons for Namely.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone the repo and ```cd``` into the directory
2. Install dependencies
```shell
$ npm install
```
3. Add new icons to ```/icons``` and run:
```shell
$ npm start
```

This turns all SVG icons in the ```/icons``` folder into a font file, creates relevant scss, and creates a json file of all the icon information. Generating files will add the package version number to all the names.
